# LeetCode Explorations

My exploration of LeetCode problems using various programming languages.

## About This Repo

This is my personal journey through LeetCode problems, where I explore different implementation approaches across multiple programming languages. Each problem gives me an opportunity to compare language features and strengthen my programming skills.

I'm especially interested in comparing:
- JavaScript vs TypeScript implementations to highlight type system benefits
- Different language paradigms and their impact on algorithm implementation
- Performance characteristics across languages

## Testing Approach

Each problem includes a test runner that:
- Validates solutions against LeetCode-style test cases
- Works across all language implementations
- Measures and compares execution time
- Verifies edge cases (manually identified)

Performance data is collected and visualized using Julia, with charts stored alongside solutions in each problem folder.

## Structure

Each folder is named with the problem number and title, containing:
- Solution attempts in different languages
- A README with my notes and observations

```

## Progress

| # | Problem | Python | JavaScript | TypeScript | Go | Swift | C | C# | Julia |
|---|---------|--------|------------|------------|-----|-------|---|-----|-------|
| 1 | [Two Sum](./001_two_sum) | ✓ | | | | ✓ | | | |
| 2 | [Add Two Numbers](./002_add_two_numbers) | ✓ | | | | | | | |

## Languages

These are simply languages I enjoy working with:
- Python
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Go
- Swift
